#Differences between GET and POST request.

*Some key design philosophies of Linux are that users have total control and the system assumes users are computer literate.(i.e no hand holding)

*A virtual private server is a virtual machine(shared with private *aspects) that runs its own copy of an operating system, and houses files, folders and other data

*It is a bad idea to run programs as the root user because root has *access to everything.  This ultimate access leaves all aspects of your *system vulnerable to virus, attacks, bugs etc
